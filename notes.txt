1. anagram = 2 words contain exact same letters in different order
  - split and sort each word to see if they are exact match

2. if words have different cases can still be anagrams
  - Tea = Eat
  - .downcase to compare

3. add rule to check if inputs are words
  - must contain a vowel (a,e,i,o,u)
  - if no vowels  output = "You need to input actual words!"
  - if word contains?(a,e,i,o,u) do
    anagram method
    else
    "You need to input actual words?

  4. antigrams = words with no matching letters ("hi", "bye")
    if word_one_letters !contain? word_two_letters do
      "These words have no letter matches and are antigrams"
  
  5. multiple words being anagrams or "antigrams"
    - eliminate spaces and punctuation .match(/\.|,|!|\s/)
    - ???
    - take in 1 string that is separated as words
      -phrase.split(' ')
      - list of words
      for loop
